# üóº The Towers

The Towers is a minigame where teams of players compete to score a maximum of points by entering a pool inside their enemy's base.

The Towers is one of the minigames made for the [Nucleoid Project](https://nucleoid.xyz/), an effort to build an open source ecosystem for server-side Minecraft minigames.
You may even be interested in playing some of them over on our testing Minecraft server at `nucleoid.xyz`!
You can also find us on our [Discord](https://nucleoid.xyz/discord) if you have any troubles or queries, or would like to get involved.
